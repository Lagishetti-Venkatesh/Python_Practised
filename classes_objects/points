Abstraction: hiding the data from user is called abstraction.
    1. no underscore ==> public (can access)  obj.variable
    2. single underscore ==> protected (can access) obj._variable
    3. double underscore ==> private  (can access) obj._classname__variable

*args = can take many arguments
Inheritance: inheriting the one class(parent) into another class(child)
    a. one to one.
    b. multiple inheritance.
    c. multi-level inheritance.
3. In multimple inheritance you can get the variable name directly using self.variable if it is dclared
    outside of the init function in parent class.
    first class passed argument will overrides the second passed class.
    be careful in the order of passing the class names in multiple inheritance.
4. Multi-level-Inheritance:
    1. The classes are inherited in sequence fashion.
    2. if same variable/ function  exists in parent classes the te variable or function
        near to parent class are triggered.
